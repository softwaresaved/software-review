# Software Review Checklist

This file provides a list of questions to consider when reviewing a source code repository or other software distribution point.

This checklist is based on [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk)'s [Checklist for a Software Management Plan](https://www.software.ac.uk/sites/default/files/images/content/SMP_Checklist_2016_v0.1.pdf), v0.1, 2016.

# Using this checklist

The document is written in GitHub-flavoured Markdown (see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)). You can use it as a checklist however you wish. The raw Markdown can also serve as the basis for a GitHub [task list](https://help.github.com/articles/about-task-lists/) or GitLab [task list](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#task-lists).
